# Variables

Peering Manager provides a set of pre-defined variables depending on the type
of the template that you are writing. These variables holds data that
represents what is inside the database. As such, some variables are exposed as
SQL query results packed into Python objects allowing easy data processing and
consumption.

If you have troubles fetching or parsing data, even by using additional Jinja2
filters, please share them in an issue so they can be addressed.
